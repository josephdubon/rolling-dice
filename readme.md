## Description

When rolling two six-sided dice, each die will show a number between 1 and 6. When the numbers on the two dice are added together, they will sum to a number between 2 and 12.

Here's an example of the kind of output your program might produce:

2: 32  
3: 50  
4: 76  
5: 120  
6: 151  
7: 161  
8: 125  
9: 121  
10: 89  
11: 52  
12: 23
